# Zodiac-Sign-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
This project explores whether **personality traits** can be used to predict a person’s **zodiac sign** using **machine learning** techniques.  The goal is not to prove astrology scientifically, but to analyze how well personality-based survey data can be classified into zodiac categories using a data-driven approach.
